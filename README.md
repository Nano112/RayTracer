# Basic java raytracer
This is a basic raytracer implmentation that supports transparent and reflective materials

A scene is composed of primitives added to a shapes list and a light source


## Example
As is it generates 360 scenes to compose an animation

Here is an animation example shocasing opaque, reflective and transparent materials:
